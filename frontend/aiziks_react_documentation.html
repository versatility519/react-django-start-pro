1. The webpack compile our react component application in src folder and compile it into main.js
    static files which will be used by the frontend template

2. The 'now' usable main.js static file is now being added before the closing body tag
    of our application templates index.html file

3. so we need to install our devDependencies i.e webpack, webpack-cli

4.we install babels too used for transpiling our javascript code to newer features from es2015 and beyond\
    and also install react-preset

5. we install react react and react-dom for react components and DOM rendering

6. In order to used the devDependency presets and plug we need to create a file called .babelrc in
    the root project directory
7. This is the actual compile main.js that we include in index.js
    main.js is  our compile js file

8. the --watch flag is used in the dev script to watch any changes made to the program

9.  React.Fragment is a named export variable which is used to render multiple component to the App.js file
10. In order to use the devDependency presets and plug we need to create a file called .babelrc in
    the root project directory
