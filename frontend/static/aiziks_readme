1. This static frontend part will be the compiled javascript
so webpack takes our react application in the src/components folder
    using the index.js as the entry point and compile it down to a file called main.js in the
    static/frontend folder

    Babel is used for transpiling javascript

    when u run npm run build; it will create static folder with our static assets
